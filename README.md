While for patients who recieved Immunotherapy, either whether or not developed the toxicity, mean of all basophil counts tested within 2 months from their bronchoscopy was used. Two-tailed Mann-Whitney test was then used to compare each group's basophils count and reported p-values were plotted over this plots.
